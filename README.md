# Agentic AI Portfolio

This repository serves as a **central portfolio** of my work in **Agentic AI** —
focusing on autonomous systems, AI-driven decision making, and practical applications
of large language models.

Each project is maintained in its own repository; this portfolio provides
a single entry point for review.

### 2. Agentic AI Capstone Project — F.A.I.R. (Financial Analysis & Integrated Risk)

**Repository:**  
👉 https://github.com/shre-yes/AgenticAICapstoneProject

**Overview:**  
F.A.I.R. is a multi-agent AI system designed to deliver comprehensive, risk-adjusted
financial advice by simulating the workflow of a human financial advisory team.
The system integrates technical analysis, fundamental analysis, risk management,
and behavioral evaluation into a structured decision-making pipeline.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-agent collaboration with specialized analytical roles
- Structured advisory workflow: Data → Strategy → Execution → Risk → Behavioral
- Dedicated risk management enforcing position sizing and stop-loss logic
- Behavioral analysis to flag market mania (fear/greed) and cognitive biases
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration using environment variables

**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Python
- LLM Provider: Gemini
- Agent Framework: Google ADK
- Architecture: Role-based multi-agent advisory system
- Configuration: Environment variables for secure key management
- Execution: Local CLI / Web UI

**Why it matters:**  
This project demonstrates real-world **agentic AI system design** by combining
autonomy, risk awareness, and behavioral intelligence. It showcases how AI agents
can collaborate in a disciplined, explainable workflow to support high-stakes
financial decision-making.
